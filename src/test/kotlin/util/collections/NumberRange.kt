/**
 * Wrote this as a replacement for the built-in [LongRange] for the [2023 Advent of Code, day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5).
 * Using elementAt and indexOf on the LongRange proved to take way too long, so this works much quicker. These methods don't
 * handle steps or other more complex functions found in the kotlin LongRange, but for this purpose, they don't need to. I
 * just needed a quick way to encapsulate a Range, and be able to check if a number is in the range, and to get the index
 * of such a number in the range, and get the Nth element in the range - again, assuming the range is sequential, positive
 * increment, step by 1, etc.
